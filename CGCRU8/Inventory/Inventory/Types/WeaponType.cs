Daggers also have fast attack as previously mentioned, and when buffed with a status effect like Bleed or a Pine Resin, they can get off massive damage in a short time. However, Daggers do have problems that set them back; Daggers have very short-range, often requiring the user to get up close to the opponent to inflict damage; they also lack the ability to trade with heavier weapons like Greatswords, Ultra Greathammers, and Ultra Greatswords due to their low poise damage and damage without buffs, so Dagger users will have to extremely cautious when going up against these weapons.";

Horizontal Ultra Greatswords have the standard Ultra Greatsword moveset when they are 1 - handed and 2 - handed, but are good for hitting multiple opponents due to its wide range.

Players with high Poise and heavier weapons like Greatswords, Ultra Greatswords, and Great Hammers will be able to tank and out-trade hits from a Curved Sword if the user is just swinging mindlessly. Additionally, if players can easily be parried if they swing without caution. The positives of this weapon class seem to outweigh the negatives, and Curved Swords attract new players and experts alike, and are popular choices in PvE and PvP.";
