      "Description": "Axes are a Weapon type in Dark Souls 3. Axes usually do decent damage and are best used on Strength/Quality builds. Most of the Axes have the Skill Warcry, which provides the weapon with a damage boost for 30 seconds. Axes are generally considered to be worse than Straight Swords, due to their lower attack speed, weaker damage output, and having an arguably worse moveset and Skill spread. However, Axes do have their own positives.Axes deal higher stamina damage, and can roll catch with more or less to the same effectiveness than Straight Swords."

These weapons often have trouble performing in close range or tight quarters. Just like Reapers, they have a 'sweet spot' mechanic that awards players extra damage. Even though the sour spots return as well, the damage difference between the sweet spot hit and the sour spot hit isn't as harsh."
